## brightness

options i looked at:
- acpid: daemon for acpi power mgmt events
- acpilight: tool that uses acpi to set brightness
- brightnessctl: command line utility that just works

after installing brightnessctl, the keyboard brightness buttons just worked. i believe this is because the config is initially set up to set functionality for those specific buttons.

## temperature
