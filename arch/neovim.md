# neovim

ok i installed neovim. it does not appear to use my vanilla .vimrc because relative line nums are not showing up. 

it looks like neovim expects a config file at ~/.config/nvim/init.vim. This does not exist off a fresh install. 

## some things to look at first

- kickstart.nvim
- lazy.nvim
- snacks.vim - picker
